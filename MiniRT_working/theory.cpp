/*
A RayTracer is a computer graphics algorithm or program that generates images by simulating the way light
 interacts with objects in a scene. It is based on the physics of light and optics and is used to create 
 realistic images with accurate shading, shadows, reflections, and refractions. Ray tracing is widely used
 in industries like visual effects, video games, and scientific visualization.

Ray tracing involves tracing the path of rays of light as they travel from a virtual camera through a scene
and interact with objects. Here's an outline of the process:
